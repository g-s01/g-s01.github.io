    Your thoughts are your message to the world. Just as the rays are the messages of the Sun.

Defeated and lost I lay, \\
Fighting my way to be relevant in life’s fray. \\
Being no good to a soul, darkness became my face, \\
Amidst this murk, a bright shine of light became my saving grace.

Heavenly it was, divinity it’s crest, \\
It was the victory of good over evil, god’s work at it’s best. \\
Having every hue, looking like a vivid brew,  \\
The light painted my life anew.

The ray, warm as fire, sparked a flame, \\
Re-igniting passion, calling my name. \\
The ray, endless and unbound, \\
Gave me inspiration newfound.
